I will discuss money and monetary policy as well as give details regarding cryptocurrencies.

# What Is Money?

No one can create all the products and services they desire.  Therefore, people *exchange* products and services.   Money is an object that facillitates this exchange.  Examples of money include convenient products such as rice and salt.  More abstract examples of money include promissory notes for products like gold notes:

Another abstract example is a tally stick that records economic transactions much like a blockchain ledger:

The most abstract examples of money are not associated with *any* product or service and have little or no intrinsic value.  An example is a one hundred dollar bill.  The only intrinsic value is the value of the paper and ink.  Other examples are cryptocurrency keys. These are just random numbers with *no* intrinsic value!

Money facillitates *storage*.  It is more convenient to store one thousand dollar bills than say horses or eggs.  Money also facillitates *distribution*.  It is more convenient to send one thousand dollar bills than say houses.  Money also facillitates *pricing*.  It is convenient to relate the values of all products and services to some type of money.

# What Is Monetary Policy?

A monetary policy is a plan to manage a money *supply*.  Some advocate fixed money supplies.  Some advocate varying money supplies.  In response to the Great Recession, many governments greatly increased their money supplies:

Satoshi Nakamoto setup Bitcoin to have a *fixed* money supply.  He was likely concerned about the possible corruption with a varying money supply.  He placed the following Easter egg in the first (genesis) Bitcoin block: "The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks".  This refers to the following newspaper cover:

# What Sets Cryptocurrency Prices?

Satoshi Nakamoto avoided a central bank and accepted a potentially fluctuating Bitcoin price:

> **Satoshi Nakamoto 2009-02-18 20:50:00 UTC**:

> **"You could say coins are issued by the majority. They are issued in a limited, predetermined amount... there is nobody to act as central bank... In this sense, it's more typical of a precious metal. Instead of the supply changing to keep the value the same, the supply is predetermined and the value changes."**

Satoshi Nakamoto believed Bitcoin prices would tend towards the cost of mining.  More people will presumably mine if that is cheaper than purchasing Bitcoin.  That would increase the difficulty, and hence the cost of mining, thereby bringing costs closer to the price.  Conversely, less people will presumably mine if it that is cheaper than purchasing Bitcoin.  That would decrease the difficulty, and hence the cost of mining, also thereby bringing costs closer to the price:

> **Satoshi Nakamoto 2010-02-21 05:44:24 UTC**:
>
> **"The price of any commodity tends to gravitate toward the production cost.  If the price is below cost, then production slows down.  If the price is above cost, profit can be made by generating and selling more.  At the same time, the increased production would increase the difficulty, pushing the cost of generating towards the price. In later years, when new coin generation is a small percentage of the existing supply, market price will dictate the cost of production more than the other way around."**

Satoshi Nakamoto believed that Bitcoin economy growth could potentially offset the inflationary effects of a growing money supply:

> **Satoshi Nakamoto 2008-11-08 16:38:26 UTC**:
>
> **"The fact that new coins are produced means the money supply increases by a planned amount, but this does not necessarily result in inflation. If the supply of money increases at the same rate that the number of people using it increases, prices remain stable. If it does not increase as fast as demand, there will be deflation and early holders of money will see its value increase."**

Even though the Bitcoin money supply is currently growing, the rate of growth is *decreasing*.  The money supply will never exceed 21 million BTC.  These attributes will likely decrease the amount of inflation.  Furthermore, Satoshi Nakamoto believed lost Bitcoin would decrease the amount of inflation due to the decrease in circulation.  He seemed to accept the possiblity of deflation:

> **Satoshi Nakamoto 2009-12-13 16:51:25 UTC**:
>
> **"[T]here will be natural deflation due to payment mistakes and lost data.  Coin creation will eventually get slow enough that... we'll have net deflation."**

The Ethereum and Ethereum Classic money supplies are also currently growing.  However, unlike Bitcoin, these systems do not have a fixed long term money supply.  There are ongoing discussions in both communities about potential changes to their monetary policies.

# Conclusion

Cryptocurrencies are innovative types of money with monetary policies that have strong protections against abuse.  As more people understand cryptocurrencies, hopefully they will gain enough confidence to benefit from them.  In the words of the inventor of blockchains:

> **"It's very attractive to the libertarian viewpoint if we can explain it properly."**
