# Benefits Over The World Wide Web

![www](http://i.imgsafe.org/6f50bb0706.jpg)

The World Wide Web is one of the most successful software systems in history.  It is a mature and widely supported platform for nearly all applications.  Therefore, it might not seem like Ethereum and Ethereum Classic could offer a compelling alternative.  Actually, they offer many benefits not provided by the World Wide Web:

* **Security** - The World Wide Web does not have strong security by default.  Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and Domain Name System Security Extensions (DNSSEC) are optional.  There are also no builtin safeguards to prevent tampering with server data.  Iran has successfully carried out man in the middle attacks against Google.  China has successfully carried out man in the middle attacks against Github.  On the other hand, Ethereum and Ethereum Classic provide much security by default.  There are no insecure communications with remote computers.  Also, it is virtually impossible to modify programs and data on their blockchains.  (It is still possible to create insecure Ethereum and Ethereum Classic applications.)

* **Censorship Resistance** - The World Wide Web does not have strong censorship resistance by default.  Megaupload is a file storage website that was successfully taken down by the United States government.    On the other hand, Ethereum and Ethereum Classic applications are copied to several computers.   Censoring these applications would require attacking every computer on the network!

* **Reliability** - Web servers are vulnerable to hardware failures.  Netflix, Instagram and other websites have suffered downtime due to Amazon Web Service outtages.  On the other hand, because Ethereum and Ethereum Classic applications are copied to several computers, downtime can only happen when every computer on the network fails!

* **Public** - Although web pages are public, web *applications* are not by default.  Wells Fargo intentionally opened over one million improper accounts for customers.  Many were charged fees for these accounts.  If their actions were public, this could have been discovered sooner or even prevented.  On the other hand, Ethereum and Ethereum Classic are always auditable by anyone anytime!

* **Trustless** - The World Wide Web requires trust in the administrators of websites to not do anything malicious.  On the other hand, Ethereum and Ethereum Classic do not require trust in anyone!

# Conclusion

Ethereum and Ethereum Classic provide many advantages not possible or not provided by default with the World Wide Web.  You may want to take them for a test drive to see for yourself.
