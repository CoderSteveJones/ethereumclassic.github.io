Emergence of Ethereum Classic created a huge opportunity for miners. ETC is presently one of the [most profitable](http://whattomine.com/) tokens to mine and is attracting substantial hash power with zero switching cost.

As a miner, it's in your best interests to support ETC because Ethereum Foundation is going to abandon its miners very soon, switching to experimental PoS model. Ethereum Classic will continue employing robust and time-tested PoW security model, rewarding miners for ensuring the future of the original chain. Do it for profit *and* principles; mine Ethereum Classic today!
