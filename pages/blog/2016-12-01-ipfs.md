# Introduction

The Internet is amazing but it is not as good as it can be.  It is several decades old and was designed for a different environment.  It does not provide adequate protections and support for the way people actually use it:

* **Security** - Security was not a major design goal.  Data is vulnerable to hardware failures, censorship and intruders.  Even today tools like Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) and Domain Name System Security Extensions (DNSSEC) are not widely used.  Security today is *optional*.

* **Mobile Devices** - The Internet was designed to allow *static* computers to effectively communicate.  Movement requires new wireless connections to be constantly set up.  Furthermore, mobile device marketshare is growing:

* **Broadcasting** - The Internet was designed to allow two computers to effectively communicate such as when sending email.  Today the majority of Internet traffic is *broadcasting* such as Netflix and YouTube:

# Glimpses Of A Better Internet

Virtual private networks (VPNs) and Tor provide better security.  Cell phone networks provide better support for mobile devices.  BitTorrent provides better support for broadcasting.  These give an idea of what a future improved Internet can look like.

# InterPlanetary File System

The Interplanetary File System (IPFS)  is one noteworthy attempt to replace the current Internet.  Security is built in by default.  BitTorrent like broadcasting gives it better performance.  Duplication of data across several computers provides censorship resistance and protection against hardware failures. There is even ongoing work to add improved support for mobile devices.

A major change in IPFS, relative to the current Internet, is to focus on the addressing of *data*.  Internet Protocol (IP) addresses currently specify machines, but as long as data is accurate, where it comes from is *irrelevant*!  IPFS addresses of all data are based on their cryptographic hashes.  This makes it virtually impossible to tamper with information in transmission.

# Blockchain Systems

Blockchains are not designed to effectively store vast amounts of data.  This is why blockchain systems can greatly benefit from systems such as IPFS.  Imagine a desired video smart contract, on Ethereum or Ethereum Classic, for which it would be prohibitively expensive to store the required videos on the blockchain.  It would make vastly more sense to store the videos on IPFS and just store the corresponding IPFS *addresses*, of all the videos, on the blockchain.

# Conclusion

There are efforts underway to greatly improve the Internet.  These efforts will make the Internet faster, more secure and more mobile friendly for all of us.  Blockchain systems are able to effectively utilize these new architectures to allow the creation of many innovative applications in the near future.  Stay tuned as it should be a wild ride.
