The Skinny On Smart Contracts: An Introduction & Why You Should Care

# Introduction

Smart contracts, as defined by Nick Szabo, are computer systems that manage assets. Assets include money, votes, passports and reputation. Examples of smart contracts include supermarket checkout systems and automated teller machines:

# Actions & Agents

In addition to specifying agreements, smart contracts can perform *actions*.  An automobile insurance plan might adjust the rate hourly based on the weather or location.   A washing machine might order replacement parts when needed:

Because smart contracts often operate autonomously, it may be more appropriate to refer to them as *agents* (autonomous software components).  On the other hand, the term smart contract is more appropriate when they manage *agreements*:

An example of a smart contract that managed an agreement would be a television that stopped working when the loan payments were in arrears.

# Blockchains

Blockchain systems, such as Ethereum and Ethereum Classic, are ideal platforms for smart contracts (agents) because of
their benefits such as security, reliability and censorship resistance:

# Improved Communication

A major benefit of smart contracts is improved *communication*.
Uncertainties in agreements such as confusing legalese and unintended loopholes incur huge costsÂ¹.  On the other hand, smart contracts are deterministic.  Furthermore, formal verification methods can help avoid software bugs.  Finally, smart contracts can have the flexibility of legal contracts.  For example, they can be designed to allow replacement under certain conditions.

# Conclusion

Smart contracts can more effectively specify and manage assets and agreements.  When implemented on blockchain systems they can have an unprecented level of reliablity and censorship resistance.

<sub>1. Some have misinterpreted the saying, "Code is law!", as implying smart contracts replace legal systems.  The
intended meaning is that blockchain based smart contracts should be immutable and unstoppable like a law of nature.</sub>
